Saiku Project Information
=========================

Saiku was created in 2008 as a test project to replace the clunky JPivot, since then we've been through a number of name and design changes until we settled upon Saiku the light weight and flexible OLAP server.

Saiku provides a fully functioning OLAP server out of the box, but can also been seen as a toolkit or framework allowing you to manipulate and extend upon it to fit your specific use case.

Saiku offers a user friendly, web based analytics solution that lets users, quickly and easily analyse corporate data and create and share reports. The solution connects to a range of OLAP Servers including Mondrian, Microsoft Analysis Services, SAP BW and Oracle Hyperion and can be deployed rapidly and cost effectively to allow users to explore data in real time.
