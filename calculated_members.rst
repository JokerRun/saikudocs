Calculated Members
==================

Starting in Saiku 3.0 we have a new Calculated Member feature that allows users to create dynamic measures within the user interface.


This pops up the calculated member dialog:

In this dialog you can edit the calculated measure name, the formula that defines the calculated measure and the output format.
Edit the formula to match your requirements and press the Ok button.
The calculated measure is then displayed in the measures list and you can then include it in the current query.
