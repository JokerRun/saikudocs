Step-by-step guide

Adding Named Users to Saiku
As an administrator, login to your Saiku Server
Open the Admin Console and click on Users List label
Add Users to the list by inserting a name into the text box and clicking Add User
Removing Names Users from Saiku
As an administrator, login to your Saiku Server
Open the Admin Console and click on the Users List label
Click on the blue cross next to the name you want to remove from the Saiku server


The list of named users is independent of any users you have in the user management section as different authentication mechanisms may not use the User Management section to create users.
The list will allow you to add more users than the license permits, but they are evaluated in list order, so for example, if you have a 10 user license and add 15 users, if the person trying to authenticate comes in the last 5, they will not be allowed to login to Saiku
